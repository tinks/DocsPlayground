# HTML5 Ad Player

How to integrate Ooyala Pulse ad delivery with your video player using the Ooyala HTML5 ad player.

## Introduction

The HTML5 ad player enables you to quickly integrate your web based video player with Ooyala Pulse for ad serving. The HTML5 ad player is based on and supports the same features as the HTML5 Pulse SDK. In addition, the HTML5 ad player automatically takes care of:

-   ad selection,
-   ad tracking,
-   ad error handling,
-   and seamlessly switching to a Flash ad player for the playback of VPAID 1.0 ads.
