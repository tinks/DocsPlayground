# Integration Process

The integration process consists of three different phases:

## Phase 1 - Introduction to Ad Serving

If you are new to integrating video ads into your applications or are you new to Ooyala Ad Products and the Ooyala Pulse adserver, you should start here. These topics contain introductions about VAST and working with Ooyala Pulse:

-   [Ooyala Video Advertising and Ooyala Pulse](../../snippets/../ad_serving/dg/faq_ooyala_pulse.md)
-   [What is VAST?](../../snippets/../ad_serving/dg/faq_vast.md)

## Phase 2 - Developing Your Integration

If you understand the basics of video ad servers and VAST, then you are ready to get started with the integration of Ooyala Pulse for ad serving into your app. During this phase, you gather all information and resources needed to develop your app and follow all the articles and tutorials to have a complete working example of an app that requests and displays ads.

## Phase 3 - Submit Integration for Validation

When you have completed your integration, you submit it to Ooyala Video Advertising for validation. The validation process is a form of final quality assurance, which validates that you have built a stable integration and that you comply to Ooyala's requirements. Read through the articles under [Validation Importance and Process](../../snippets/../ad_serving/dg/validation_importance_process.md) to prepare you for the validation process so your launch date is not held up by failing the Ooyala validation.
