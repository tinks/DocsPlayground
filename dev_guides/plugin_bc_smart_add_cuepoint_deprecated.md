# Add Cue Points

You can add cue points to your video to trigger mid-roll breaks on you videos. To set a mid-roll break, you set cue points as you normally would in Brightcove but you need some additional setting for Ooyala Pulse to identify it as a mid-roll break. To define the cue point as a mid-roll break you have to set the cue point type to **Ad** and set the name to **vpspot**. ![Add Cuepoint](../../image/add_cuepoint.jpg)
