# Phase 3 - Submit Integration for Validation \(Flash\)

When you have completed your integration, you submit it to Ooyala Video Advertising for validation. The validation process is a form of final quality assurance, which validates that you have built a stable integration and that you comply to Ooyala's requirements. Read through the articles under [Validation Importance and Process](../../snippets/../ad_serving/dg/validation_importance_process.md) to prepare you for the validation process so your launch date is not held up by failing the Ooyala validation.
