# Integration Resources

Here you will find the resources you will need to be able to perform an Ooyala Ad Solutions integration of the HTML5 platform.

## Ooyala Ad Products HTML5 1.x SDK JavaScript

Your integration can either link dynamically to the minified or un-minified SDK resource, or you can download and include the JavaScript directly in your integration.

**Dynamical linking**

Un-minified version:

```
http://{sub-domain}.videoplaza.tv/proxy/html5-sdk/1/latest/plugin.js
```

Minified version:

```
http://{sub-domain}.videoplaza.tv/proxy/html5-sdk/1/latest/plugin.min.js
```

**Note:** \{sub-domain\} should be replaced with your Ooyala Pulse account sub-domain, which can be found in your Pulse account settings.

**Download location**

The library can be found on the [Downloads](http://help.ooyala.com/downloads) page.

## Online Reference documentation

Reference documentation can be found here: [HTML5 1.x SDK documentation](http://pulse-sdks.ooyala.com/html5/latest/index.html)

**Demo Integration**
