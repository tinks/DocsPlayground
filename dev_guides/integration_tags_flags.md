# Using Tags and Flags

## Tags

Tags are descriptive keywords that can be passed along with each item or the entire player, making it easy for the traffic department to target campaigns against/away from certain content. Tags can be anything from "sport", "golf", to "male" and "sunny weather".

## Flags

Flags are pre-defined Ooyala Ad Products flags that should be included in the integration for the purpose of switching off ads for an item or a player. The available flags are described below:

-   nocom - When 'nocom' \(short for no commercials\) is provided the distributor always returns an empty ticket and hence the clip will be ad free.
-   nospots - No spot ads
-   noprerolls - No pre-rolls
-   nomidrolls - No mid-rolls
-   nopostrolls - No post-rolls
-   nooverlays - No overlays
-   noskins - No inskin ads
