# Ooyala HTML5 Plugin for Ooyala Player V4

How to integrate Ooyala Pulse ad delivery with Ooyala Player V4 using the Ooyala HTML5 plugin.

The Ooyala HTML5 plugin is the easiest and prefered way to integrate your Ooyala Player V4 with Ooyala Pulse for ad serving, because the plugin automatically takes care of:

-   ad selection,
-   ad playback,
-   ad tracking and error handling,
-   and handling VPAID 1.0 and VPAID 2.0 ads.

Currently, the plugin is limited to displaying linear ads \(pre-, mid-, and post-rolls\).

Further documentation about prerequisites, supported features, resources and tutorials is available in the [Ooyala Pulse Ad Plugin for Player V4](http://help.ooyala.com/video-platform/concepts/pbv4_ads_dev_chapter_pulse.html) page.
