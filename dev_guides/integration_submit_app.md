# Submitting Your App to Ooyala

When your application is complete you will need to submit it to Ooyala for validation before you can put it in production.

**Note:** An approved Ooyala validation of your application gives you the right to request support for any issues that are related to the serving of Ooyala ads. If any further changes are made to your application after a validation and these changes touch a component that could affect Ooyala ads, the support for this application is considered void until the application has been resubmitted for and passed a new Ooyala validation.
