# Ooyala Pulse Integration Toolkit

Ooyala Pulse Integration Toolkit makes it easy to integrate with Ooyala Pulse, the most advanced video monetisation platform on the market, and leverage Ooyala's vast experience of successful video ad integrations.

Through its plugins and SDKs, the toolkit offers a wide range of features to insert ads with the best end-user experience on any platform.

## Plugins and SDKs

The plugins and SDKs provide a wide range of interchangeable modules for requesting, inserting, showing and tracking ads and user behaviour. The offered plugins and SDKs include:

-   Plugins, which require little integration effort and have been created to easily integrate with a particular player:
    -   Ooyala Flash Plugin for Ooyala Player V3
    -   Ooyala HTML5 Plugin for Ooyala Player V4 \(see Video Platform documentation for more information\)
    -   Brightcove Player HTML5 Plugin
    -   JW6 Flash Plugin
    -   JW7 HTML5 Plugin
    -   Flowplayer Flash Plugin
    -   VideoJS HTML5 Plugin
-   Ad Players, which layer on top of your normal video player to solely play ads, require the least amount of integration effort, but still provide access to underlying classes and methods if more specialised logic is required:

    -   Flash Ad Player\*
    -   HTML5 Ad Player
    \* The Flash Ad Player development is in maintenance mode. Several web browsers \(Google Chrome, Firefox, ...\) are moving towards click-to-activate for the Flash plugin. Relevant articles:

    -   Android Pulse SDK
    -   HTML5 Pulse SDK

    -   tvOS SDK
    -   Android SDK
    -   HTML5 SDK
