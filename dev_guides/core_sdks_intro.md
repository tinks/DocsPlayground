# Core SDKs

Low level SDKs to integrate ad serving from Ooyala Pulse into your video player application.

Core SDK is the name of a range of SDKs, which enable you to control every aspect of ad requesting and playback. These SDKs, however, do not supply any of the necessary logic to request or playback ads out of the box.
