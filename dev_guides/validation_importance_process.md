# Validation Importance and Process

Ooyala Validation was created to provide expert insight and quality assurance to client advertisement integration. In the validation process a series of tests are performed and the outcome is saved in a â€˜Validation Document'. This document is then provided to the client and developer outlining the player performance and any required improvements.

The purpose of this guide is to help you in understanding the validation process, be able to run a full range of tests and get closer to a successful validation.

If you are here to conduct your own full tests, you can follow the guide as provided, if you are interested in only some areas \(see [Common Pitfalls](validation_common_pitfalls.md)\) use the following overview to navigate to the desired article.
