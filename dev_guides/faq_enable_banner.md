# Enabling Companion Banners with In-stream Ads?

To be able to run companion banners together with your in-stream ads, the following steps need to be taken:

1.  You need to create one div per companion banner area in the HTML code next to your video player with the desired dimensions and a unique ID
2.  A suggestion is to name this div using its IAB standard naming and size \(for example, `<div id="IAB_Medium_Rectangle_300x250" style="width:300px; height="250px" ...</div>`\)
3.  The companion areas you've created need to be registered with your Ooyala Pulse account in order to be able to traffic ads to them. You Technical Account Manager \(TAM\) will be able to help you do this. Just send your TAM a list of your desired companion area IDs and we will help you set them up.
4.  Now, you will be able to book companion banners together with your in-stream ads that will appear within the desired divs.
