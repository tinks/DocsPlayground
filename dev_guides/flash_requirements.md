# Flash Integration: Requirements

When integrating with Ooyala Ad Products, there are several requirements that must be met for it to function properly with all ad formats:

1.  ActionScript 3-compatible Flash video player
2.  The integration is available for the entire ad session \(meaning, loaded only once\)
3.  The integration is notified about relevant clip metadata \(for example, cue points, tags\)
4.  The integration is informed of the current video state throughout the session \(pre-play, playing, paused, complete\)
5.  The embedded Flash video player must have an object ID for JavaScript support from the Ooyala Flash Ad Player
