# Flash Testing and Debugging Checklist

-   Auto-play/Autostart: does the player and ad playback function correctly with both auto-play enabled and auto-play disabled?
-   No ads: if there are no ads to be shown does your player/control bar work correctly?
-   Is your player making a new ad request \(setNewItem\) only when the user presses play?
-   Allow script access <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /\>
-   The embedded Flash player object has an ID?
-   If you mute your player before you press play, does the ad start muted?
-   If you resize your player before you press play, does the ad start in the correct size?
