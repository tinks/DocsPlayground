# Pulse SDKs

High level SDKs to integrate ad serving from Ooyala Pulse into your video player application.

Pulse SDK is the name of a range of SDKs, which simplifies integrating a video player application with Ooyala Pulse for ad serving significantly. The Pulse SDKs define a strict and simple communication protocol, allowing developers to quickly build simple event driven integrations. The Pulse SDKs automatically manage:

-   ad tracking,
-   error handling,
-   passbacks for 3rd party ads,
-   and prompting the video player to play ads.

The generic architecture of a Pulse SDK integration would look as follows:
