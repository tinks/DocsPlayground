# Flash Integration: Resources

Here you will find the resources you will need to be able to perform an Ooyala Ad Solutions integration of the Flash AS3 platform.

## Ooyala Ad Products Flash Public Library

Your integration can either link dynamically to the SDK library, or you can download and include the library directly in your integration.

**Dynamical linking**

```
http://{sub-domain}.videoplaza.tv/proxy/flash-sdk/latest
```

**Note:** \{sub-domain\} should be replaced with your Ooyala Pulse account sub-domain, which can be found in your Pulse account settings.

**Download location**

The library can be found on the [Downloads](http://help.ooyala.com/downloads) page.

## Online Reference documentation

Reference documentation can be found here: [Flash SDK documentation](http://pulse-sdks.ooyala.com/flash/latest/index.html)

## Demo Integration

A simple demo integration is provided here for reference. This example illustrates how an integration with the Ooyala Ad Products Flash SDK could be done and is intended to be an inspiration for you when designing your own application.

**Warning:** This demo is not intended to be used in production and Ooyala does not support or fix issues that may arise from blindly copying code from this demo into your integration.
