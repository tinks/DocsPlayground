# Ad API

The Ad API complements the [Booking API](rest_booking_api.md) by providing endpoints for creating ads and uploading assets. These endpoints are currently not part of the Booking API, because they use a different base URL, communication format and authentication.

Swagger documentation for the Ad API \(Create Ads and Upload Assets\) is located at: [https://api.videoplaza.com/v1/swagger](https://api.videoplaza.com/v1/swagger).
