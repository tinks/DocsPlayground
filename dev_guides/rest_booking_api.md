# Booking API

The Ooyala Pulse user interface is built on the Ooyala Pulse REST API, which enables you to use this API to retrieve and alter what you can see and do in the UI.

These pages contain information on the following API resources:

-   [Campaign](rest_campaign_endpoint.md)
-   [Campaign Rules](rest_campaign_rules_endpoint.md)
-   [Goal](rest_goal_endpoint.md)
-   [Goal Rules](rest_goal_rules_endpoint.md)
-   [Client](rest_client_endpoint.md) \(Advertisers, Agencies, and Brands\)
-   [Contact](rest_contact_endpoint.md)
-   [Site](rest_site_endpoint.md)
-   [Shares](rest_shares_endpoint.md) \(Categories and Content Partners\)

**Note:** the Booking API currently does not contain endpoints for creating ads or uploading assets. Endpoints for these actions do exist, but have a different base URL, use a different format and authentication. These endpoints are described under [Ad API](rest_ad_api.md), and have Swagger documentation at [https://api.videoplaza.com/v1/swagger](https://api.videoplaza.com/v1/swagger).
