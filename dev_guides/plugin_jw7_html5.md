# JW7 HTML5 Plugin

How to integrate Ooyala Pulse ad delivery with the JW Player version 7.x using the JW7 HTML5 plugin.

## Introduction

The JW7 HTML5 plugin is the easiest and prefered way to integrate your JW7 Player with Ooyala Pulse for ad serving, because the plugin automatically takes care of:

-   ad selection,
-   ad playback,
-   ad tracking and error handling,
-   and handling VPAID 1.0 and VPAID 2.0 ads.

Currently, the plugin is limited to displaying linear ads \(pre-, mid-, and post-rolls\) and pause ads.

## Plugin Location and Tutorial

To integrate, you must have a JW Player version 7.x up and running on your site, as well as an Ooyala Pulse account and a unique ID \(pulseHost\).
