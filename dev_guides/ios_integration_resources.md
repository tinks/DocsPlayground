# Integration Resources

Here you will find the resources you will need to be able to perform an Ooyala Ad Solutions integration of the iOS platform.

## Ooyala Ad Products iOS Core Framework file

The core and debug frameworks for creating an iOS integration can be found on the [Downloads](http://help.ooyala.com/downloads) page.

The Ooyala Ad Products Core Framework file gives you access to the VPAdCallModule and the VPTrackingModule.

The VPAdCallModule facilitates the requesting of ads from the Ooyala Pulse video ad server and parses the ad response into well formatted native object for easy use.

The VPTrackingModule assists in performing the appropriate tracking requests for an ad and makes sure that the capping and consistency rules that Ooyala requires are properly enforced.
