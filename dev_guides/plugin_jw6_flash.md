# JW6 Flash Plugin

How to integrate Ooyala Pulse ad delivery with the JW Player version 6.x using the JW6 Flash plugin.

## Getting Started

To integrate, you must have a JW Player version 6.x up and running on your site, as well as an Ooyala Pulse account and a unique ID \(vpHost\).

1.  Set the "plugins" flashvar to the following: `plugins: "http://cdn.videoplaza.tv/resources/flash/jw6/latest/vp_plugin.swf"`
2.  Set the "vpHost" plugin parameter to your unique Ooyala Pulse subdomain `{ vpHost: "http://{your-unique-subdomain}.videoplaza.tv" }`

You should now be getting ads from your Ooyala Pulse account \(assuming you have booked them\).
