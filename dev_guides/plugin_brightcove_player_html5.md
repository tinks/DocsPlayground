# Brightcove Player HTML5 Plugin

How to integrate Ooyala Pulse ad delivery with the Brightcove Player version 5.x or higher using the VideoJS HTML5 plugin.

## Introduction

The Brightcove Player HTML5 plugin is the easiest and prefered way to integrate your Brightcove Player with Ooyala Pulse for ad serving, because the plugin automatically takes care of:

-   ad selection,
-   ad playback,
-   ad tracking and error handling,
-   and handling VPAID 1.0 and VPAID 2.0 ads.

Currently, the plugin is limited to displaying linear ads \(pre-, mid-, and post-rolls\) and pause ads.

**Note:** This plugin replaces our older [\(Deprecated\) Brightcove Perform Plugin \(HTML5\)](plugin_bc_perform_html5_deprecated.md) and any customers using the older plugin are recommended to migrate over to this plugin as soon as possible.

## Plugin Location and Tutorial

To integrate, you must have a Brightcove Player version 5.x or higher up and running on your site, as well as an Ooyala Pulse account and a unique ID \(pulseHost\).

The plugin is located on GitHub: [Ooyala Pulse Plugin for VideoJS and Brightcove Player](https://github.com/ooyala/pulse-sdk-html5-2.x-plugin-videojs). This location contains:

-   the plugin source file,
-   information on how to build the project,
-   a tutorial on how to get started with an integration,
-   information on any optional steps in the integration,
-   and the API reference documentation.
