# Validation Process Information

Before you can put your application into production and get support, Ooyala requires that your application is validated. For this reason it is good to familiarize yourself with our validation protocol before your write any code. This will help you integrate Ooyala Ad Products' SDK in the correct manner from the start and not waste time trying to retrofit unexpected requirements.

## The Ooyala Validation

The Ooyala Validation was created to provide expert insight and quality assurance to a client advertisement integration. An approved validation is also a requirement for you to receive any support for your application. In the Validation process a series of tests are performed and the outcome is saved in a Validation document.

Here are some of the things that we will test during the validation process:

-   Error handling for bad ad request or faulty assets
-   Support for different ad types and insertion points
-   Best practices for making ad request and performing tracking

This article provides you with a good overview of what needs to be in place to pass an Ooyala validation: Preparing your app for validation
