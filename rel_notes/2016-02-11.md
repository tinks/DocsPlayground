Ad info available in ad error events on Flash SDK, new Pulse SDK for Android

## Ad info available in ad error events on Flash SDK

Previously, information about the ad was passed along with any tracking error events \(TRACKING\_ERROR\_EVENT\) in the Flash SDK. Now we have extended the same functionality when ad error events \(AD\_ERROR\_EVENT\) are sent. This allows you to extract more specific information about the ad that caused an error, like the ad ID, URL, format, and so on.

## Pulse SDK for Android

In our new range of SDKs, a new Pulse SDK for Android is available, which simplifies integrating with Pulse significantly. The Pulse SDK defines a strict and simple communication protocol, allowing developers to quickly build simple event driven integrations. The Pulse SDK automatically manages:

-   ad tracking,
-   error handling,
-   and prompting the video player to play ads.

The Android Pulse 2.x SDK is available for download on the [Downloads](http://help.ooyala.com/downloads) page, under the Video Advertising heading.

A sample integration is found on [github.com/ooyala](https://github.com/ooyala/pulse-sdk-android-2.x-sample).
