Survey element available through SDKs

## Survey element available in Flash SDK and iOS 2.x SDK

The optional VAST \(Video Ad Serving Template\) **survey element** is used to store the URI to a survey vendor that could be the survey, a tracking pixel, or anything to do with a survey. The element could be used to display a survey accompanying a specific ad, when that ad is served to the viewer, or the survey might only be activated if the viewer has paused ad playback. For each ad served, there is at most one survey URI available.

Now, the survey element is exposed through the Flash and iOS 2.x SDKs, which enables customers to handle this element in their integration when it comes in with ads from 3rd party ad providers.

For the Flash SDK, there are 3 important additions to the SDK that enable the access to this survey element:

-   The method **currentAd** on **VpAdModule** returns an Ad object, which is the ad currently being shown.
-   On the **Ad** object, we then have the property **survey**, which returns the survey URI.
-   A new event, **CURRENT\_AD\_UPDATED**, has been added to **VpAdModuleEventType**, which is triggered whenever **VpAdModule.currentAd** is updated \(a new ad has started playing\).

For the iOS 2.x SDK, the survey element is accessed through **VPAd.survey**.
