Skipping ads in HTML5 Pulse SDK

## Skipping ads in HTML5 Pulse SDK

The Pulse SDK allows you to see if an ad should be skippable through the exposed core ad object, but previously provided no means to skip the rest of the ad.

Now, the adSkipped method has been added to the OO.PulseVideoAd object, which should be called when the viewer has clicked the skip button. This method triggers the display of the next ad if one is available, or the content otherwise.
