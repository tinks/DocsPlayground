Preview capability in the HTML5 Pulse SDK.

## Preview Capability in the HTML5 Pulse SDK

From versions 2.1.16.19.2, the HTML5 Pulse SDK supports previews, which allow you to preview an ad as a preroll without doing any tracking. This functionality is handy to test your Pulse integration with a real ad request to Pulse, but without tracking the ad and creating false impressions. Preview can be achieved in two ways:

-   While still developing the integration on your local environment, you can add the ID of the ad you want to preview in the `pulse_preview` property of the request settings.
-   After deploying the integration to a staging environment, you can add `pulse_preview=the-pulse-ad-id-you-want-to-preview` to the URL of the page. For example,

    ```
    http://my.site.com/playerintegration.html?pulse_preview=the-pulse-ad-id-you-want-to-preview
    ```


**Note:** this is also available for the HTML5 Ad Player and the plugins based on this ad player: Brightcove Player HTML5 Plugin, VideoJS HTML5 Plugin and JW7 HTML5 Plugin.
