# 2015-10-15 Release

Android 2.x SDK

## New Integration SDK: Android 2.x SDK

A second generation version of the Android SDK is released, which is used to develop the ad serving integration for your native Android video player application.

Integration with Android 2.x SDK supports the following new features:

-   **Passbacks**: another ad is requested if no ad was served in the first request
-   **Session information**: enables session level clash protection \(only one ad from a group of mutually exclusive ads is ever shown in one session\) and ad sequencing. For more information on clash protection, refer to [Client Categories](../ad_serving/ug/client_categories.md).

To start using these features, you have to \(re\)write the Android integration with the new Android 2.x SDK, for Android 2.2 or later and preferably using Java 7 or later. Contact Professional Services for help and validation at [sthlm-psg-team@ooyala.com](mailto:sthlm-psg-team@ooyala.com).

The necessary resources to start developing can be found here: [http://help.ooyala.com/downloads](http://help.ooyala.com/downloads), under Video Advertising, Android.
