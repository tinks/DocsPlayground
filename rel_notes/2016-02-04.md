Logging on Pulse SDKs & HTML5 Core SDK adParameters

## Logging enabled in HTML5, iOS and tvOS Pulse SDK

Previously, your integration with Ooyala Pulse using one of the Pulse SDKs was not able to get log messages. Now, new methods are available to create a log listener, which picks up any error and warning messages. These messages relate to, for example:

-   Problems in network responses, which may be caused by a misconfigured Pulse account or third party servers.
-   Network request failures, like a failure to get the a requested session from Pulse.
-   VAST responses from third party servers that do not conform to the VAST standard.
-   Coding mistakes in the integration, like a missed argument or wrongly typed argument.
-   And so on.

These messages help you debug your integration during development, and help you identify any issues that may occur in production.

The new methods are:

-   **HTML5**: OO.Pulse.setLogListener
-   **iOS & tvOS**: OOPulse.setLogListener

## VPAID 2.0 enabled in HTML5 Core and Pulse SDKs

In order to handle VPAID 2.0 ads in your video player, you need access to the <AdParameters\> element in the VAST response. In the HTML5 Core and Pulse SDKs, we now expose this element through the adParameters method on the creative.
