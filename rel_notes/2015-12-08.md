Pulse SDKs for iOS and tvOS

## New Integration SDK: Pulse SDKs for iOS and tvOS

Pulse SDK is the name for the new range of SDKs that Ooyala AdTech is developing, which simplifies integrating with Pulse significantly. The Pulse SDKs define a strict and simple communication protocol, allowing developers to quickly build simple event driven integrations. The Pulse SDKs automatically manage:

-   ad tracking,
-   error handling,
-   and prompting the video player to play ads.

Pulse SDKs are now available for iOS and tvOS, in the iOS 2.x SDK framework and tvOS 2.x SDK framework, respectively. Note that the core SDKs are still available, the Pulse SDKs have simply been added to the existing frameworks. The frameworks are available for download on the [Downloads](http://help.ooyala.com/downloads) page, under the Video Advertising heading.

A sample integration for both iOS and tvOS, using the Pulse SDKs, is found on [github.com/ooyala](https://github.com/ooyala/pulse-sdk-ios-2.x-sample).
