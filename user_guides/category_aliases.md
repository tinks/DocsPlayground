# Category Aliases

Aliases are a great way to keep the taxonomy for your categories in Pulse the same as in your video content management system, or to create your own content naming convention. Aliases are plain text names. Set up an alias for content you want to track on a specific category. The video player then passes this information to Pulse for it to be logged and visible in your category reports.

1.  Click on the desired category in order to expand the tab.
2.  Click on the menu for identifier information and click **Edit aliases**:![Edit Category Aliases](../../image/pulse_account_content_category_edit_aliases.png)
3.  Enter your list of comma‚Äêseparated aliases. You can also use wildcards, for example sport\* means that all tags beginning with sport are included.
4.  Click **SAVE**.
