# Uploading Ad Assets Manually or Automatically

Pulse provides two ways of managing the assets used in the ad delivery:

-   **Using the Ooyala Pulse Asset Factory**: upload one creative file of any format and automatically transcode and generate video assets to go on to any device or service you choose.
-   **Manual Upload**: manually upload each video asset for any device or service you choose.
