# Add Targeting Rules

## Content Targeting

1.  Expand the tab. You see two options:
    1.  **Include**: the campaign/goal is delivered to all players sending any category/share alias that corresponds to the chosen content category
    2.  **Exclude**: the campaign/goal is never delivered to a player sending any category/share alias that corresponds to the chosen content category
2.  Click on the desired option. The **Select content to include** page opens up.
3.  Select the box next to the desired content category.
4.  Click **SAVE**.

**Note:** Exclude settings always override include settings. If a content category is both included and excluded, this results in the campaign/goal not being delivered on that category.

## Tag Targeting

1.  Expand the tab. You see three options:
    1.  **All of**: pick campaign/goal as long as all of the tags configured in my targeting are included among the tags in the ad request
    2.  **At least one of**: pick campaign/goal as long as any of the tags configured in my targeting are included among the tags in the ad request
    3.  **None of**: pick campaign/goal as long as none of the tags configured in my targeting are included among the tags in the ad request
2.  Click on the desired option. The **Add tag rules** page opens up.
3.  Enter the desired tag name. It appears in search results.
4.  Select the tag from the search results. To add another tag, repeat steps 3 and 4.
5.  Click **SAVE**.

## Geotargeting

**Note:** Metro area targeting is not enabled by default. Please contact your Account Manager if you want to use this feature.

1.  Expand the tab. You see two options:
    1.  **Allow viewers from**: define in which countries/regions/cities/metro areas you want to allow your campaign/goal
    2.  **Deny viewers from**: define in which countries/regions/cities/metro areas you do not want to allow your campaign/goal
2.  Click on the desired option. The **Add location rules** page opens.
3.  Start typing the name of the desired country, region, city or metro area and a list appears in search results. You can also search metro areas by entering the metro area code.

    **Note:** For some names there is the option of adding it both as country and region. Doing this might cause problems with the geo lookup service used to identify what geo location an end user is from. Therefore, choose only country OR region, if the two are named the same.

4.  Select the country, region, city or metro area from the search results. To add another country, region, city or metro area, repeat steps 3 and 4.
5.  Click **SAVE**.

**Note:** If you leave both options empty, all countries are allowed to view your ads.

## Frequency Capping

1.  Expand the tab.
2.  Click on the **New frequency capping rule** option. The **Add frequency rules** page opens up.
3.  Cap campaign views per user by:
    1.  inserting the maximum number of ad impressions that you want to allow for a certain time period
    2.  choosing the time period, from the pop up window, during which the user is allowed to see the defined number of ad impressions
4.  Click **SAVE**.

**Note:** If you want to create a combination of capping rules, repeat the steps to set another capping rule.

## Time of Day/Day of Week Targeting

    3.  choose the exact time \(hours and minutes\) between which the campaign or goal should be active or inactive, or check the "Full day" box if you want the campaign or goal to be active or inactive during the whole day
4.  Click **SAVE**.
