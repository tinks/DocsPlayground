# Insight

Insight is a reporting tool which can break down your data into the following parts:

-   **Filters**: define what part of the data in the data engine is of interest,
-   **Dimensions**: define how to break down the data in the report output,
-   **Metrics**: define the data points that you want to display in the report. Each metric is displayed in a separate column in the final report.

Insight is used for:

-   pulling reports,
-   creating new custom reports,
-   sharing reports with people without their own Pulse accounts.

All three uses are discussed in the following sections.
