# Ooyala inPage User Guide

Ooyala inPage allows you to show advertising inside web pages, where no video player is present and where the ad playback is not associated with video playback. For example, a news company that presents news articles to the public, can monetize these web pages with Ooyala inPage.

The Ooyala inPage User Guide is currently available as a [PDF](http://help.ooyala.com/sites/all/libraries/dita/en/video-advertising/pdf/inPage_User_Guide.pdf).
