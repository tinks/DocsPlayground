# Insight Reports Menu Options

1.  You can access reports quickly by adding them to the menu of the relevant item, for example the campaign menu.
    1.  Click the desired report's menu. A pop up window opens up:

        ![Insight Report menu](../../image/pulse_insight_report_menu.png)

    2.  From the list of options, click on the menu name to check or uncheck it. By checking the menu name, you add that report to the item's menu. For example, the above report "Campaign performance by day" can now be accessed directly from the campaign menu in Campaigns Overview, as shown below:

        ![Report added to campaign menu](../../image/pulse_insight_add_report_to_menu.png)

2.  You can delete custom report templates by clicking the **Delete** button. However, you cannot delete default report templates.

**Note:** When the last custom report template for a certain dataset is deleted, it is no longer possible to pull reports on that dataset because Insight stops aggregating the data.
