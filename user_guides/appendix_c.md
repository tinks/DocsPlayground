# Appendix C - Pulse Audience Management \(PAM\)

## What is Audience Targeting?

Audience targeting is a way to target certain audiences by requesting ads with specific audience parameters. A very typical case is age and gender, where age and gender are two different parameters of the same targeting. It is possible then to send gender together with an age to get a certain content served. Audience targeting is available on global, campaign and goal level, just as with any other targeting. It can be combined with all other targeting rules.

## Data Integration

In order to use Pulse Audience Management functionality, you first need a data integration added to your account. Discuss this with your Account Manager. When created, the providers can be enabled or disabled.

Factors to consider when using Pulse Audience Management:

-   **Initiate the data integration project well before you run your first campaign**: it can take anything from a few days to weeks from the point that you realize that you want to work with external data, until you can run your first campaign, all depending on your data source. Make sure that you know at what date the data should be accessible in Pulse before you book your first campaign using it.
-   **Wait for the data to be transferred before you run campaigns**: audience data needs to be transferred to Pulse before you can use it, so wait for a while \(the timeframe depends on the data source\) before you start targeting campaigns to it. If you have any questions, contact your Account Manager.

When this functionality is enabled, you will be able to use audience data in forecasting and reporting.
