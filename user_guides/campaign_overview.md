## Parts of the Campaign Overview

|Part|Name|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|1|Campaign information|Basic information about the campaign. Double-clicking the pen icon gives you the option to edit. Read more about campaign status and campaign progress bar in [Monitoring Tools](monitoring_tools.md).|
|2|On/Off button|All new campaigns are deactivated by default, so that they cannot go live before setup has been completed. When you finish adding goals and ads, you can launch the campaign using the on/off button. Of course, the campaign does not start delivering until it reaches its start date.|
|3|Campaign menu|Campaign menu options. For more information, see below.|
|4|Campaign performance chart|When the campaign is launched and has gathered data, you see a chart showing the amount of impressions and click-throughs for all formats together, or for a specific format, during a certain time period. Hovering over the bars gives you detailed information. Hide the performance chart by clicking this field.|
|5|Performance chart menu|Click the menu to choose a time period for which you want to get performance data. You can get data from yesterday, last week, last month, or since start. The data can be presented by hour, day or week, depending on the selected period.|
|6|Export|When the campaign is launched and has gathered data, clicking the button opens a new window with a table overview of the performance chart data.|
|7|Campaign metrics|Short overview of some of the most important metrics.|
|8|Campaign settings|Overview of some of the campaign settings. Double-click the pen icon to edit. Some of the settings can only be set here:1.  **Campaign mode**:
    1.  Normal mode: other campaigns can be displayed in the same content session.
    2.  Exclusive mode: the campaign has exclusive rights to the entire content, which means that no other campaign is selected even if there are more slots to fill. Running a campaign as exclusive means that all available ad formats for that campaign are selected and populate an ad break before any other ads are chosen. While the exclusive mode is good for creating a high impact branding opportunity, there is a risk that inventory could be wasted.
2.  **Sequence scope**: this feature is related to **Goal sequencing** and explained in [Goal Overview](goal_overview.md).
3.  **Global tracking**: this feature is enabled by default. You can choose to disable global external tracking for individual campaigns. For more information on global tracking, refer to [Global Tracking](settings.md#global_tracking).
4.  **Exclude from forecast**: you can choose to exclude a campaign from the Planner forecasting results, for example filler and in-house campaigns. It allows you to see what inventory is available for sale. This does not affect ad delivery.

    -   The campaign has the same settings as the original campaign.
    -   It contains the same goals and ads as the original campaign.
    -   The campaign is automatically inactivated to prevent it from running immediately.
    -   The name of the duplicate campaign is set as <original campaign name\> - Copy, but can be changed before actually duplicating the campaign.
    -   The start date of the campaign can also be changed before duplicating, which means the goals inherit the same start date.
-   **Pull reports**: if you added an Insight report to the campaign menu, you have the option to pull a report from the campaign menu. If you do not have this option and want to enable it, refer to [Insight Reports Menu Options](insight_reports_menu_options.md).
