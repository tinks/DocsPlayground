# Planner Interface Overview

When you open the Planner from the menu \(![Planner Icon](../../image/pulse_planner_icon.png)\), you see the following interface:

## Parts of the Planner

|Part|Name|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|1|Create Simulations|Buttons to create new inventory and campaign forecasts. For more information on creating simulations, refer to [Create Inventory Simulation](planner_create_inventory_simulation.md#) and [Create Campaign Simulation](planner_create_campaign_simulation.md#).|
|2|Recent Simulations|A list of simulations, indicating the type of simulation, status, and summarised result.

Only simulations run in the past 14 days are kept in the list of recent simulations, because the results from older simulations are outdated and have become meaningless. You can also only see the simulations you have created under your user name.

|3|Actions|Action buttons.|
