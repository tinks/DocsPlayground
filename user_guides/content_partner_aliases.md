# Content Partner Aliases

Aliases are plain text names. Set up an alias for content you want to track on a specific content partner. The video player then passes this information to Pulse for it to be logged and visible in your content partner reports.

1.  Click on the desired content partner in order to expand the tab.
2.  Click on the menu for identifier information and click **Edit aliases**:![Edit Content Partner Aliases](../../image/pulse_account_content_partners_edit_aliases.png)
3.  Enter your list of comma‚Äêseparated aliases. You can also use wildcards, for example disney\* means that all tags beginning with disney are included.
4.  Click **SAVE**.
