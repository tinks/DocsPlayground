# Advertisers, Agencies and Brands

The procedure for adding advertisers, agencies and brands is the same and it is explained in this section.

1.  Open the Clients tab from the menu \(![Clients icon](../../image/pulse_clients_icon.png)\).
2.  From the Clients Overview, select the tab you wish to add a new client to.
3.  Click on **Add new advertiser/ agency/ brand** button, depending on the tab you selected.

    A new page opens up:

Now, you can double-click the pen icon to edit the existing information, and you have two more options:

1.  **Add contact**: this opens a new window where you can enter the information about the client's contact person.
2.  **Show all campaigns from advertiser, agency or brand**: this takes you to the Campaigns Overview and shows you a list of campaigns filtered by client.
