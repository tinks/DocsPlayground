# Targeting Rules

## What are Targeting Rules?

Targeting rules are a mechanism used to filter ads according to specific content and users. Targeting rules can be set at different levels in a hierarchical order:

-   **global level**,
-   **campaign level**,
-   and **goal level**.

You can also **create targeting templates** if you need to use the same targeting rules often. This will simplify your work. Each level has the same set of targeting rules to choose from.
